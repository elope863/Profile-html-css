            <p class="presentacion__conetenido__texto">I am a customer experience professional with over a decade of expertise in delivering exceptional service, resolving conflicts, and building trust across industries like hospitality, travel, and tech. Currently a Liaison Representative at Marriott Vacations Worldwide, I serve as the primary contact for agent and owner concerns, combining problem-solving skills with empathy to drive satisfaction and uphold service standards. My career spans roles such as Senior Advisor at Vistana Signature Experiences, where I streamlined complex customer resolutions, and technical support at Logitech, where I honed my ability to troubleshoot hardware and software challenges. Fluent in English and Spanish, I thrive in multicultural, remote environments, balancing operational excellence with a human-centered approach.

            <p class="presentacion__conetenido__texto">Beyond customer service, Ive embarked on a transformative journey to re-enter the tech world, fueled by a passion for continuous learning. While maintaining my full-time role, Ive earned certifications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and programming logic through Alura Latam (2025), mastering front-end development fundamentals like Flexbox, file structures, and responsive design. Complementing these technical skills, Ive also focused on personal development, completing courses in productivity, self-directed learning, and LinkedIn optimization to stay agile in a fast-evolving digital landscape. This dual focus—bridging customer-centric expertise with coding—reflects my commitment to growth and adaptability.</p>
            <p class="presentacion__conetenido__texto">Re-entering tech has been a challenging yet rewarding adventure. Juggling work, learning, and life demands discipline, but certifications like “Aprender a aprender” (Learning to Learn) and “Curso de Foco” (Focus Strategies) have equipped me with frameworks to stay organized and resilient. Whether debugging code or resolving customer issues, I approach problems with curiosity and grit, determined to evolve alongside industry trends. My goal is to merge my customer experience insights with technical skills, creating solutions that are both innovative and deeply human—proof that its never too late to pivot, learn, and thrive in a world that never stops moving.</p>
